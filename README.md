simple-db
=========
This is the code repository for a simplified database management system, which includes basic functionalities such as command parsing, storage management, trasaction management, and so forth. This is not an dead project, I will continuously update it. And hopefully it will finally be a distributed strong consistency cloud database, like TiDB or CockroachDB, although it is unlikey in the lifetiem to implement such a complex system, I will still move forward to that direction
